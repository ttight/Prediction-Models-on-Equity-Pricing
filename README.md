# Prediction Models on Equity Pricing


For CIS 545: Big Data Analytics, the final project is to gather usefull insights from data of your choosing.

My group chose to use various prediction models to find statistical meaning in equities data.

In this project we use: PCA, Lasso & Ridge Regression, Linear Regression, and various other ways of analyzing equities data. 

The **Cis_545_ProjectNotebook.ipynb** file contains the code for data wrangling, cleaning, modeling, and results with graphical representations of analysis and results as well as text explanations and reasoning. 

Here's a simple but interesting graph that was apart of our takeaway section where we explored the validity of sentiment analysis as a model factor:

And here's a heat map we used to measure the mutlicolinearity of our predictor variables in the linear regression portion of the project:
