# Prediction Models on Equity Pricing


For CIS 545: Big Data Analytics, the final project is to gather usefull insights from data of your choosing.

My group chose to use various prediction models to find statistical meaning in equities data.

In this project we use: PCA, Lasso & Ridge Regression, Linear Regression, and various other ways of analyzing equities data. 

The https://github.com/ttight/Prediction-Models-on-Equity-Pricing#:~:text=Cis_545_ProjectNotebook.ipynb file contains the code for data wrangling, cleaning, modeling, and results with graphical representations of analysis and results as well as text explanations and reasoning. 

TODO: Add the takeaways section from the notebook into the readme
